# Static Analysis for Reals

This is a project with the goal of designing and implementing a program modelling language that allows for the efficient evaluation of arbitrary static assertions about the program's behavior.

Right now, the project is still in the problem-solving stages, so it would be best to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Zistack/program-modeling-language/wiki), where the current language design is being presented.
